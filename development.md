# Development log

I found on line couple implementations of algorithm to align images, but it's not suitable for this project.

This needs to be done visually. After all that's where all the fun of the project lays in.
I should create an interface that helps me quickly translate and otherwise transform the images (particuarly, their EDGE DETECTION results)
with live feedback for interactive work.
I think this will help make all sorts of custom effects, including for stereoscopy.
